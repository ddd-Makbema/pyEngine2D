# pyEngine2D

## Welcome 
Welcome to pyEngine docs (seperate from pyEngine3D) <br />
These docs will contain the functions nessesary to write 2D games in the engine with definitions of many main terms. 
These docs are orginized into general folders of topics such as the physics engine or basic rendering.

## Getting Started
1: Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install pygame to allow it to work.

```bash
pip install pygame
``` 
2: look at [Variables](MainFiles/Variables.md) to see the basics of how to initialize game objects <br />
3: learn how to write scripts, add media and initialize game objects by making a basic pong game in the [Tutorial](Tutorial/Introduction.md)<br />
4: for indepth descriptions of how the engine works look at [MainFiles](MainFiles/GameLoop.md)
5: to look at what attributes are in the builtin scripts and also what they do, look at [Builtins](Builtins/Collisions/Colliders2D.md)
